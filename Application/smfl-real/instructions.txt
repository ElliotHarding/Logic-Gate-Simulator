(*) Use "z" to zoom in & "x" to zoom out

(*)In the bottom right hand coner of the screen is the add page
   button this adds a page

(*)The link button allows gates to be linked 
   (see next page for more info)

(*)The new button removes all gates and links, as well as resets 
   other properties

(*)The load button loads any saved gates from a file

(*)The save button saves any gates (types, properties, positions) 
   (does not currently save links =( )

(*)The quit button is self explanitory

---------------
The two top buttons (<- & ->) are for switching inbetween pages 
giving you acsess to differnt types of gates.

Process of linking gates:

Step 1: Press link button
Step 2: Select any gates output attacher
Step 3: Select any gates input attacher
Step 4: Link is then generated

* It is possible to link gates over pages
* Having multiple links from/to one attacher is possible

---------------
Using 4-bit memory:

*Four attachers (right) --> The read attachers

*Top attacher (left) --> The increment array position attacher
	--> sending a signal to this will increment the array 
		position from which data is read from

*Bottom attacher (left) --> The reset attacher
	--> sending a signal to this will reset the array position 
		reader to 0

Bool reader is similar to the 4-bit memory execpt it only emmits
one signal
